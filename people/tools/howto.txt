This is a brief description of the new version of the people_app.
More detailed documentation will come in my blog in the end of GSOC.

The app has been extended with following flags:

-segment_people <path_to_svm_file>     activates the segmentation: false by default
-lzf  <path_to_svm_file>    reading data from lzf files    false by default
-lzf_fps  <lzf_fps>    reading data from lzf files    fps for reading the lzf files: 30 by default
-resample <bool_value>    activates the upsampling. Caution: experimental, only works with pcd files and inactive segmentation (happens manually)
-tracking <bool_value>    activates tracking (on skeleton level, implemented in people_detector.cpp)

Without the additional flags the app works as before (tracking, segmentation etc. are disabled by default).

Examples of execution

Live from kinect, active segmentation and tracking:
./pcl_people_app -numTrees 3 -tree0 /path_to_tree_files/tree_20.txt -tree1 /path_to_tree_files/tree_20_1.txt -tree2 /path_to_tree_files/tree_20_2.txt  -segment_people /pcl/gpu/people/data/trainedLinearSVMForPeopleDetectionWithHOG.yaml -tracking 

From lzf files, active segmentation and tracking:
./pcl_people_app -numTrees 3 -tree0 /path_to_tree_files/tree_20.txt -tree1 /path_to_tree_files/tree_20_1.txt -tree2 /path_to_tree_files/tree_20_2.txt  -segment_people /pcl/gpu/people/data/trainedLinearSVMForPeopleDetectionWithHOG.yaml -lzf ./path_to_lzf_data_dir/ -tracking 1
